## Lyrics

```
i've been living every day like i'm kneeling to the bad
you've been killing all your vice while i see it with my eyes

i got evil on my mind, problems giving it a rise
won't be solved with any time what can never be aligned

went through this alone, crept into the thought with doubts
made it to the other side and back alive, back alive

now i'm only thankful, still resentful of the feeling in my heart

```
